# Artificial Intelligence Software Agents


## Achievements

- 1.Version(03.03.2022):
  + A clear, detailed plan, and direction for the semester.
  + We have collected enough data sheets to input the simulation.
  + We have started to implement the code for the tree and the environment.

- 2.Version(17.03.2022):
  + We have declare on how much Agent will affect our Simulation: Human, Tree, Animal, Terrain, Weather
  + The Spawn Locations of the Tree will be decide on the QGIS map. It will be map as a .csv map with number from 0 to 3:
    + 0: represent the empty Location
    + 1: For the NutmegTree
    + 2: For the PalmTree
    + 3: For the BrazilNutTree
  + The Weather Data for the picked location is available
  + The Tree Agent, Tree Layer, Terrain layer, Weather Layer are implemented and can communicated with each other
  + Details UML about the Communication between Classes. 
  + Simulation Method is chosen and been research for the implemented. 

## 2 Week Goal:
- All of the Agent and Layer are implemented, up and running.
- Simulation are implemented
- Finish small things like: Comment on Code and working on the documentation
## Research Question(s):

- What role do humans play in the growth of the rainforest? Would it make a big difference for the forest if humans were not included in the calculation?
- What happens in the event of a fire or other rare event? Does that have a big impact on the rainforest? Because the temperatures in the forest are pretty much the same all year round.

## Topic: 
Simulation of all aspects that have influenced the rainforest in the past and compare the result with different configurations 

## Description
Our project will be a simulation of a scaled down version of the Amazon rainforest over the years (years unknown) that displays the effects of deforestation. Our agents include trees, humans, and animals. Trees have the fields of age (seeding, juvenile, & adult), growth rate, amount of wood, type (palm, Brazil nut, or member of the nutmeg family), fruit production, is alive, seed distribution, and resistance to external factors. Humans have the actions of lumbering, planting seeds, moving, and harvesting fruit. Animals have the actions of eating fruit, pooping, dying, reproducing, and moving.
There are also external factors that affect the rainforest, including the weather. Weather includes rainfall, sunlight, humidity, and other factors such as flooding and forest fires.
This simulation is beneficial to the understanding of rainforests. Rainforests are rapidly being destroyed by many factors, many that can be limited to help protect the rainforests. With this simulation, knowing what specific factors that contribute most to the demolition of rainforests can help us find a solution for the quickly shrinking rainforests, as well as developing strategies for better forestation.
This would include finding a better balance for growing and dying trees. When we know the rates and factors that are contributing, we will be able to predict the future of rainforests if we continue to treat the rainforests the way we have been. And when we can predict the future using the current rates, we can proactively curb the rate of deforestation.
